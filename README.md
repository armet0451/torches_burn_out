# torch-burnout
makes torches burn out :3


Instead of mixing in to vanilla torches, this mod adds its own torch block extending HorizontalWallAttachedBlock or whatever its called which replaces them in recipes and loot tables. This has the benefit of leaving naturally-generated torches unaffected and also making things way easier. Vanilla torches use an entirely separate block class for torches on the ground and wall torches which is a really silly leftover from minecrafts history. These just use a `face` blockstate which im 90% sure is how it would be done if torches were added today - thanks cassian for letting me copy ur homework for this one
